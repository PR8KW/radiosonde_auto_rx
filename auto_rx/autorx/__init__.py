# RTLSDR Usage Register - This dictionary holds information about each SDR and its currently running Decoder / Scanner

#   'device_idx': {
#       'in_use' (bool) : True if the SDR is currently in-use by a decoder or scanner.
#       'task' (class)  : If this SDR is in use, a reference to the task.
#       'bias' (bool)   : True if the bias-tee should be enabled on this SDR, False otherwise.
#       'ppm' (int)     : The PPM offset for this SDR.
#       'gain' (float)  : The gain setting to use with this SDR. A setting of -1 turns on hardware AGC.

# Currently running task register.
#   Keys will either be 'SCAN' (only one scanner shall be running at a time), or a sonde frequency in MHz.
#   Each element contains:
#       'task' : (class) Reference to the currently running task.
#       'device_idx' (str): The allocated SDR.
